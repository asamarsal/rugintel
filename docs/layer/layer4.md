# Layer 04: Market Intelligence (10% Weight)

Market Intelligence focuses on the "behavioral authenticity" of the token's trading activity. It distinguishes between genuine investor interest and artificial volume (wash trading) created by the deployer to entice "FOMO" from retail traders.

## 1. Screening Methodology

This layer analyzes the transaction stream to find circular and non-organic patterns:

1. **Volume-to-Organic Ratio:** Comparing total trading volume against the number of unique active wallets.
2. **Circular Flow Detection:** Identifying "Loop" transactions where funds move between a small set of wallets to inflate volume.
3. **Tax Configuration Audit:** Checking for hidden "Buy/Sell Tax" traps that prevent investors from exiting.

## 2. Key Parameters & Thresholds

| Parameter            | Threshold                | Influence    | Detection Logic                                                                     |
| :------------------- | :----------------------- | :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Wash Trading**     | Vol > $1M & Wallets < 50 | 🔴 CRITICAL  | Indicates that most volume is fake and generated by a few bot accounts.             |
| **Circular Flow**    | >30% Circular            | 🔴 High Risk | Detects if Wallet A sells to B, and B sells back to A repeatedly.                   |
| **Slippage Trap**    | Sell Tax > 20%           | 🔴 High Risk | A common scam where you can buy (0% tax) but cannot sell without losing most funds. |
| **Buy/Sell Balance** | Linear Growth            | 🟢 Safe      | A healthy balance of buys and sells from diverse wallet addresses.                  |
| **Holder Velocity**  | Stable Increase          | ✅ SECURE    | Steady growth in unique holders indicates organic community building.               |

## 3. Logical Screening Scenarios

### 🔴 High Risk (Rugpull Probability Boost)

- **The "Volume Miracle":** A coin has $5,000,000 in volume within 1 hour, but only has 12 unique holders. This is 100% automated wash trading.
- **The Sell Trap:** The contract is configured with a 99% sell tax. Investors "buy the dip" but their tokens are effectively worth zero because they cannot be sold.
- **Ping-Pong Trading:** Miner detects that 80% of volume is coming from only 3 wallets trading among themselves.

### 🟢 Low Risk (Safe Indicator)

- **High Unique Interaction:** Large number of unique wallets (500+) relative to the volume, suggesting a broad distribution of interest.
- **Transparent Tax:** 0% Buy / 0% Sell tax with a renounced contract.

## 4. Technical Requirements for Miners

Miners in this layer focus on **Transaction Stream Analysis**.

### A. DexScreener / Birdeye / Defined API

- **Usage:** Miners need high-speed access to aggregated DEX data to monitor volume and wallet counts.
- **API Requirement:** Pro/Enterprise API keys are often needed to get sub-minute updates on volume spikes.

### B. Heuristic Pattern Matching

- **Logic:** Algorithms that track the "Life of a SOL" to see if it endlessly returns to the same 3-4 wallets.
- **Tooling:** Python `pandas` for time-series analysis of transaction density.

### C. Simulation Engines

- **Usage:** Miners may run "Transaction Simulations" to test if a 'Sell' order would actually succeed on-chain given the current contract state.

## 5. Scoring Formula (Layer 04)

`L4_Score = (Wash_Trading_Penalty * 0.4) + (Slippage_Trap_Penalty * 0.4) + (Circular_Flow_Penalty * 0.2)`

**WARNING for Miners:** Be careful of "MEV Arbitrage" which can sometimes look like wash trading. Advanced miners distinguish between profitable arbitrage and malicious wash trading designed to fake organic growth.
