   Allows top-performing Miners (with 98%+ accuracy) to sell their "Verified Safe" launch signals. RugIntel takes a **10% Protocol Fee**.
2. **Rugpull Recovery Service (Success Fee):**
   Automated tracking of stolen funds to CEXs. If funds are frozen/recovered via RugIntel's lead, we charge a **15% recovery fee**.
3. **Audit-as-a-Service (Vetting):**
   Legitimate projects can pay for a "Deep Scan Vetting" where top Validators manual-review the 12-layer data to provide an official RugIntel Audit PDF.
4. **Subscription via Burn (Deflationary Model):**
   Users can pay for 'Pro' tier by "Burning" a small amount of TAO, making the entire Bittensor ecosystem more valuable.
